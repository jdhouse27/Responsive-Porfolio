        <p>  Where do I begin?  I suppose I should start at the beginning.  I started off, as most do with computers, in that I was terrified if I got into an area of the unknown
           I would surely break something beyond possible fixing.  This series of unfortunate events would not only distroy my pride, but also would end up costing me more then 
           I could ever dream of.  I will admit there are still many areas that scare the living daylights out of me.  However, by the time I finish the KU Bootcamp I will have 
           gained many skills which have not only allowed me to face my fears head on, but also given me the confidence the developer I am today.  One who is now a developer of 
           choice to employers.   
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I have always been good at things I put my mind to and I look forward to the next chapters in my life.  I have experience in health care, food and beverage, management,
           owner of a business, and now web development.  My experience in health care consists of 9 years as a Registered Respiratory Therapist, as well as 3 years of EMR application 
           support.  In the Food and Beverage industry I have experience in all aspects, server, bartender, expoditor, cook, manager, general manager, and owner. My experience with 
           web development has just begun, however throughout this website you will notice the many skills I currently have. Though my expertise may not be extremely advanced yet 
           I live by a motto my grandfather taught me: "Lack of progression leads to regression".  I am always looking for new growth and advancement.
